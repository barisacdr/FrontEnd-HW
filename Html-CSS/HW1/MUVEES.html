<p> This site is all about movies as its name says. There are movies from imdb top list. Those are no doubt some of the best movies out there but not everyone have to like them. </p>

<P> I also included my personal favorites and movies released recently. I'll comment the recent movies I went to watch and copy the summaries of those I didn't watch. I hope you'll have some ideas about them if you want to go. </P>
